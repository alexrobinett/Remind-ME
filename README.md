## Features

Remind ME allows users to:

- Add reminders with a title, description, due date, and priority
- Edit existing reminders
- Delete reminders
- Mark reminders as completed
- Add reminder groups/projects

## Technologies Used

Remind ME was built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack

## Improvements

- Reduce event listeners: One way I would improve the app is by implementing event delegation. This would involve adding an event listener to the reminder container, which would allow event bubbling to occur and enable handling of each reminder's delete and update functionality through an event handler.
- Improve mobile and desktop UI: improve desktop and mobile UI to be more Mobile friendly and scalable.
